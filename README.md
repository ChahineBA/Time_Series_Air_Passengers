# ✈️ Time Series Analysis of Air Passengers 📊

This project explores **time series forecasting** using a dataset of monthly air passenger numbers 📅. The goal is to predict future trends in air travel demand based on historical data 📈.

## Key Highlights 🔍
- 📅 **Time Series Decomposition**: Analyzed the data for trends, seasonality, and residuals.
- 🧠 **Modeling**: Implemented various forecasting models, including:
  - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
  - Prophet
- 📈 **Performance Evaluation**: Used metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE to evaluate the accuracy of the forecasts.
- 🎨 **Visualizations**: Created plots to visualize the time series data and forecasted trends.

Check out the code to see how time series models can be applied to real-world data! Feel free to try it out and forecast future air passenger trends ✈️📆.
